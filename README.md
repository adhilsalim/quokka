# Quokka: Arduino Library for Large Language Models (LLMs)
<img src=".repo/banner/banner_0.jpg" width="400" alt="Quokka Arduino Library Banner">
Quokka is an Arduino library that simplifies interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's API and Hugging Face Transformers. It empowers you to integrate the power of LLMs into your Arduino projects, enabling features like:

* Text generation
* Text translation
* And much more!

**Current Status**

* **[In Progress]** Implementing Gemini API
* **[Planned]** OpenAI API support
* **[Planned]** Hugging Face Transformers support

**Installation**

1. Download the library folder from this repository.
2. Place the folder inside your Arduino libraries directory. You can find this location by going to **File > Preferences** in the Arduino IDE.

**Usage**

**[Coming Soon!]** We're actively working on developing a comprehensive usage guide that will detail how to interact with various LLMs through Quokka. This guide will include code examples to get you started.

**Example**

**[Coming Soon!]** Once the library is complete, we'll provide a detailed example showcasing how to use Quokka in your Arduino project. 

> [!NOTE]
> This project is in its early stages of development. We welcome collaboration and contributions! If you'd like to get involved, feel free to reach out to cloudfoxapps@gmail.com. Your contributions can help us shape Quokka into a powerful tool for the Arduino community.
